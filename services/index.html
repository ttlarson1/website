                        <h2>Depression</h2>
                        <p class="paragraph">Depression affects more than just your mood — it can impact your energy, motivation, relationships, and overall sense of self. It often shows up as persistent sadness, irritability, lack of interest, brain fog, or sleep issues — and it doesn’t always have a single, clear cause.</p>
                        
                        <p class="paragraph">At Emerald Bridge Wellness, we take a personalized approach to treating depression. As a dual-certified Psychiatric and Family Nurse Practitioner, I look at the full picture — mind and body — to uncover what may be contributing to your symptoms. This may include lifestyle factors, nutrient deficiencies, stress, relationships, underlying medical issues, and more.</p>

Depending on your unique needs, we may explore options such as therapy, medication, supplements, or lab testing to guide care. For some, hormone fluctuations can play a role, but it’s just one piece of the puzzle.</p>

                            <h2>Anxiety</h2>
                            <p class="hover-text">Living in a constant state of worry or tension can take a toll on both your mental and physical health. Anxiety often shows up as racing thoughts, restlessness, irritability, difficulty sleeping, or trouble focusing — and while it may be triggered by stress, its roots can run deeper.
                                <br><br>
                                When anxiety goes unaddressed, it doesn’t just affect your mental well-being — it can have lasting effects on your physical health, too. Chronic anxiety keeps the body in a prolonged state of stress, which can lead to inflammation, hormonal imbalances, elevated blood pressure, digestive issues, and a weakened immune system. Over time, this increases the risk of conditions like heart disease, gastrointestinal disorders, insomnia, chronic pain, and even autoimmune issues.</p> 
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="box below-text">
                        <p class="hover-text">The mind and body are deeply connected — and when one is struggling, the other often follows. Addressing anxiety early with a thoughtful, tailored treatment plan can support not just emotional balance but also long-term physical health.
                            <br><br>
                            At Emerald Bridge Wellness, I take a comprehensive approach to anxiety treatment that considers the whole person. As a Psychiatric and Family Nurse Practitioner, I combine medical insight with mental health expertise to uncover what’s fueling your symptoms. This could involve evaluating lifestyle factors, exploring thought patterns, checking for nutritional or metabolic imbalances, and looking at how your nervous system is functioning.
                            <br><br>
                            Treatment options are tailored to you and may include therapy, supplements, medication, or lab work to guide next steps. In some cases, hormones or thyroid function may contribute as well.
                            <br><br>
                            If anxiety is disrupting your daily life or relationships, you deserve support that addresses both mind and body. Let’s work together on a plan that helps you feel more calm, grounded, and in control.

                            <h2>Nervous System Dysregulation</h2>
                            <p class="hover-text">
                                Some symptoms don’t fit neatly into a single box.
                                <br>
                                You may have been told it’s anxiety. Or hormones. Or stress. Yet your body still reacts in ways that feel bigger than your thoughts — sudden heart rate surges, flushing, lightheadedness, brain fog, digestive shifts, heightened sensitivity, or a sense that your system is always “on.”
                                <br><br>
                                Nervous system dysregulation occurs when the autonomic nervous system becomes imbalanced. The body’s stress response activates too easily or has difficulty settling. This can develop after prolonged stress, illness, hormonal shifts, trauma, or seemingly “out of nowhere.” The result is a cycle where physical symptoms and anxiety begin feeding each other.
                            </div>
                    </div>

                            Our approach is integrative and physiologically informed. We assess patterns carefully, screen for contributing factors, and evaluate how stress biology, mood, hormones, and lifestyle intersect. Treatment may include  medication review, targeted supplementation, nutritional strategies, and structured nervous system regulation techniques designed to create stability — not dependence.
                            <br><br>
                            When the nervous system feels safe, the mind follows. Our goal is not simply symptom control, but restoring resilience, clarity, and a sense of grounded control so you can function at a high level again.

                            <p class="hover-text">Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight isn't just about appearance — it's about feeling better physically, mentally, and emotionally. Excess weight can contribute to fatigue, low mood, anxiety, and even chronic health conditions. A thoughtful, personalized approach to weight loss can restore energy, improve confidence, and support better overall mental well-being. 
                                <br><br>
                                At Emerald Bridge Wellness, we approach weight loss as a holistic journey — not a quick fix. As a dual-certified Psychiatric and Family Nurse Practitioner, I look beyond the number on the scale and explore the deeper factors that may be influencing your weight. These can include stress, emotional eating, sleep issues, metabolic changes, or lifestyle habits.

                            <h2>Genetic Testing for Mental Health Medications</h2>
                            <p class="hover-text">Finding the right psychiatric medication can often feel like a process of trial and error—but it doesn't have to be.
                                <br><br>
                                At Emerald Bridge Wellness, we offer <strong>GeneSight<sup>®</sup></strong> testing to help personalize your treatment plan. This at-home genetic test analyzes how your body processes certain psychiatric medications based on your unique DNA, providing insights that can guide more effective and better-tolerated treatment choices.
                                </p>
                        </div>

                            The process is straightforward: a kit is mailed to your home, you complete a simple cheek swab, and return it in the prepaid envelope. Within a few days, I receive a detailed report that categorizes medications into three groups—medications likely to be effective, medications that may require dose adjustments or closer monitoring, and medications that may have a higher risk of side effects or reduced effectiveness.
                            <br><br>
                            This personalized approach can help reduce side effects, improve outcomes, and shorten the time it takes to find the right medication—especially for individuals struggling with depression, anxiety, ADHD, PTSD, or mood disorders.
                            <br><br>
                            Cost and Insurance Coverage
                            <br><br>
                            Insurance coverage for the GeneSight test varies. Medicare and Medicaid typically cover the full cost, resulting in a $0 out-of-pocket expense. For those with Medicare Advantage or commercial insurance plans, the out-of-pocket cost is generally $330 or less. If your estimated cost exceeds $330, GeneSight will contact you before processing the test to discuss options, including financial assistance or an interest-free payment plan. For uninsured patients, a reduced self-pay option of $330 is available, and financial assistance programs may also be applicable.
                            <br><br>
                            If you're curious whether genetic testing could support your care plan, let's talk. It might be the key to finally finding the right fit for your mental health needs.</p>
