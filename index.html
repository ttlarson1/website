                    <h3><strong>Healing that meets you where you are — mind, body, and soul.</strong></h3>
                    <p><strong>Emerald Bridge Wellness</strong>
                        provides virtual integrative psychiatry services for adults across Minnesota and Wisconsin. We combine conventional mental health treatment with functional and holistic principles to address anxiety, depression, OCD, nervous system dysregulation, and stress-related conditions.                        
                        <br><br>
                        Many individuals come to us after feeling partially helped — but not fully well. You may experience elevated heart rate without clear cause, persistent anxiety, mood shifts, fatigue, brain fog, sleep disruption, or physical symptoms that accompany emotional stress. Rather than focusing on symptoms alone, we evaluate the full picture, including lifestyle stressors, sleep patterns, hormone balance, inflammation, gut health, and nervous system regulation.
                        <br><br>
                        Our care model blends thoughtful treatment review, medication optimization when appropriate, functional lab evaluation, and targeted lifestyle strategies. Some individuals benefit from traditional approaches. Others prefer a more integrative path. Most benefit from a carefully balanced combination — guided by evidence and individualized to your physiology.
                    </p>
                   
                    <p>Healing should feel steady, informed, and empowering. If you're looking for virtual psychiatric care with a functional lens,

                        <p>
                            As a dual-certified Psychiatric Mental Health and Family Nurse Practitioner, I bring both clinical expertise and a compassionate, integrative approach to care. My practice blends psychiatry, primary care, and functional medicine to a systems biology–based, root-cause approach that looks at the whole person, not just symptoms.
                            <br><br>  
                            Functional medicine is patient-centered and science-based, using your personal history, genetics, environment, and lifestyle to guide care. It emphasizes prevention, sees the body as an interconnected system, and integrates conventional treatments with nutrition, supplements, stress management, and more.
                            <br><br>  
                            Whether you’re facing hormonal shifts, sleep issues, gut health concerns, or chronic stress, these factors can quietly influence your mood, focus, and well-being. Together, we’ll take a deep look at your story, not just your symptoms, and create a personalized plan that may include medications, hormone support, supplements, or a more natural path forward.
                            <br><br>  
                            If you’re looking for whole-person mental health care in Minnesota or Wisconsin, I’d be honored to support you via telehealth.

Many symptoms of anxiety, depression, burnout, mood instability, and even focus concerns can be rooted in nervous system dysregulation.

                        We are in-network with select insurance plans including Aetna, UnitedHealthcare/Optum, Cigna, and BlueCross.

                                Your initial intake appointment is a comprehensive, in-depth evaluation designed to understand the full picture of your health. We explore current symptoms, medical and mental health history, stress patterns, nervous system responses, lifestyle factors, and your personal goals. This is not a rushed visit. It is an intentional time to connect the dots and build a personalized treatment plan that supports both symptom relief and long-term regulation.

Follow-up visits allow us to monitor progress, adjust treatment plans as needed, assess nervous system regulation, and continue supporting sustainable change. Depending on your needs, these sessions may include brief therapy, coping tools, and regulation strategies to help you feel more steady and confident in daily life.

                            Our practice continues to focus on <strong>integrative telehealth care</strong>, offering support for mental health, hormonal balance, and wellness through non-controlled medication management, supplements, and holistic approaches.

                                <h4>Owner | Emerald Bridge Wellness</h4> <br>
                            <p>As a dual-certified Family and Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner, I’ve spent years working in traditional healthcare and while it has its strengths, I often felt limited by the “one-size-fits-all” model. I wanted to offer more than symptom checklists and medication scripts. I wanted to truly support the whole person.
                                <br><br>
                                That’s what led me to create Emerald Bridge Wellness. Emerald represents hope and renewal. Bridge represents connection between the mind and body, between traditional and functional medicine, and between medical care and true wellness which creates space for treatments that are as unique as the people I serve.
