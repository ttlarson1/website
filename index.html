                        <p>As a seasoned professional in the field of mental and physical health, I have had the honor of working with a diverse range of patients - from young adults to seniors. <br> <br>My ultimate goal is to empower and guide clients towards overcoming depression and anxiety as well as other challenges in mood that may be standing in the way of your mental and emotional well-being. <br> <br> Regardless of your age or the difficulties you may be facing, my unwavering focus remains on providing you with the tools and support necessary to lead a successful and joyous life. <br><br> Weight loss and hormone imbalance can also present challenges in physical and mental well-being. Not only can hormone imbalance plague your mental health as we age, it can also increase our risk for cardiac disease, bone loss, and cognitive changes. Increased weight, as we all know, can also have effects in cardiovascular disease, but can can worsen fatigue, endurance, and play a major role in self-esteem. <br><br></p>
